# Sentiment analysis in the Cloud with AWS Lambda.

It shows how to build a sentiment analysis machine learning model by using a pubic dataset and how to deploy it to production with AWS Lambda and API Gateway.

## How to install requirements

OS libraries can be installed as follows (Linux):

    $ sudo yum install -y atlas-devel atlas-sse3-devel blas-devel gcc gcc-c++ lapack-devel python27-devel

Python requirements can be installed with pip.

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    
## Training phase

You can train and persist the model into file by executing:

    $ python main.py

## Test the model locally

You can run the model via CLI as follows:

    $ python predict.py "This function is awesome"
    > positive
    
## How to deploy the Lambda function

Simply execute the following deployment script:

    $ ./deploy.sh

It will automatically create a new deployment package containing every Python dependency and the OS libraries required by scikit-learn and numpy, together with the "lambda" folder.

[Here](https://github.com/ryansb/sklearn-build-lambda) you can find the whole stack ready to be uploaded  ([reference](https://serverlesscode.com/post/deploy-scikitlearn-on-lamba/)).

Once the deployment package is ready, you can create a new AWS Lambda function and bind it to a new Amazon API Gateway endpoint.
